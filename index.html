                    Hello everyone! My name is Julie and this is my first web page ever.
                    I'm pretty excited about it.I spent about 4 hours with creating this masterpiece :D
                    I hope I'll be more quicker next time.
                    <br>I love reading books and watch TV series. Also I play computer games a lot, but I'm not a nerd :D Not yet.
                        I do active sports too, actually I am quite hell of a dancer, and "hell" means "hell yes" not "get this girl hell out of here" :D
